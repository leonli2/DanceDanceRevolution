# Background
Arrows fly up across the screen and once they match the arrow outline at the top of the screen, the player should press the corresponding key.<br/>
These arrow keys are generated randomly and have a fixed speed.
The objective is for the player to score as much points as they can in 60 seconds.
There is also a combo tracker, which increases by 1 everytime the player sucessfully hits the correct arrow with the correcting timing.
This combo multiplies the points they get from subsequent arrows.

There are 4 accuracy types depending on how close the player was to pressing the arrow key at the correct time (WOW, GOOD, OKAY, MISS).
1. WOW means perfectly aligned or very close
2. GOOD means somewhat close
3. OKAY means touching the arrow outline
4. MISS means that the player either let the arrow hit the top or pressed the wrong key.
These give 3, 2, 1, and 0 points respectively.
Note that a MISS resets the combo to 0.

# How to Play
First, press KEY0 in order to start the game.
This will then start a countdown, after which the game begins.
Once the keys overlap their outline, the player should press the corresponding key.
To score more points, they should try to get a combo by avoiding a MISS.
After 60 seconds, the game is finished.
